# Bakery Sales Data Analysis
## Description
We will delve into a dataset containing sales records from July 1, 2013, to July 30, 2018, encompassing various factors influencing bakery sales. The aim is to harness your machine learning skills to create a model that identifies and leverages patterns within this dataset to forecast future sales.

## Impact
If successful, we'll have flexed some new skills in a real world example. For bakeries, it could lead to more efficient inventory control, reduced food waste, and improved customer satisfaction by ensuring the availability of products. Participants will have the opportunity to apply and showcase their skills in a real-world scenario, contributing to advancements in data-driven decision-making in retail.

# Plan & Strategy

## Workflow

### Steps
1. **Import Data**
2. **Clean Data**
3. **Assess Data Quality**
4. **Merge Datasets**
5. **Basic Statistics** (e.g., t-tests, significance checks)
6. **Feature Engineering**
7. **Modeling & Evaluation**
8. **Reporting & Insights**


### Notes
- first.ipynb can be used for the playground and testing environment.
- We can put all the csv data in data directory and it will be ignroed so that we are not pushing any data file to repo.



## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Add your data files to the `data/` directory.
3. Open and run the notebooks in your preferred environment.

### Git Workflow
We are following trunk base workflow for git
- Git checkout main
- Pull main branch: git pull main 
- Create a feature branch: git branch -b feat/new_feat
- Commit Changes and push to your branch
- create a pull request from your branch (feat/new_feat) to main

**Happy Coding :)**
